			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img src="https://github.com/lion6786/fictional-robot/blob/master/sailing.jpg?raw=true" alt="Photo of me on a sailboat" style="width:400px;height:400px;">
			<p>I have spent all of my life living around the water or spending my time on/in it, and I wouldn't ask for it to be any other way.</p>

			<p>I am an active member in the Florida Xi chapter of Phi Delta Theta. Being in a fraternity has brought me on a path to becoming the best version of myself, and taught me valuable lessons along the way.</p>

			<h3>Website Accessibility & Usability</h3>
			<h4>What I ensured was widely accessible and usable.</h4>
			<div class="useList">
				<ul>
					<li>Images</li>
					<li>Straightforward layout</li>
					<li>Text</li>
					<li>Screen size</li>
					<li>Document structure</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Images</h4>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>I used alt text with any images such as pictures or videos so that if there was a reason that the image could not be shown, or if the user is using a text-only setting so that they will still be able to understand the sites content.</p>
			</div>
				<h4>Straightforward layout</h4>
			<div>
				<p>While designing the website I knew that I wanted it to be navigated easily and be visually appealing, therefore a two column format with a header and fixed menu were used.</p>
			</div>
				<h4>Text</h4>
			<div>
				<p>To ensure readability and proffesionalism, I chose the Arial font and large text size</p>
			</div>
				<h4>Screen size</h4>
			<div>
				<p>To make sure that the website is available to be viewed on different devices and window sizes I had the two segments stack on top of eachother if the size of the website went below a ceratin amount.</p>
			</div>
				<h4>Document structure</h4>
			<div>
				<p>When users navigate to different pages within the website I wanted to make sure that the layout remained consistent and clear. And that users understood where on the website they were able to navigate to.</p>
